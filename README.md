comparing the performance of BERT model with different sample sizes 

this code will help in measuring the performance of BERT model with different sample sizes using the same dataframe

this code is updated version of the code from this tutorial (https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/) by Chris McCormick
